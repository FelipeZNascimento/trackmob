This is my first React app and was created for Trackmob.<br>
It's a simple To Do list with "Add", "Check" and "Delete". You can access at https://sharpion.github.io/trackmob/

## Details
- The app was developed based in React tutorials at https://reactjs.org/docs/.
- React Native was not used but the application is mobile-responsive - I've used react-materialize as a tool.
- React-Loadable, storybook and jest were also not used.
