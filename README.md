This is my first React app and was created for Trackmob.
You can access at [https://sharpion.github.io/trackmob/]

## Details
- The app was developed based in React tutorials at [https://reactjs.org/docs/].
- React Native was not used but the application is mobile-responsive - I've used react-materialize as a tool.
- React-Loadable, storybook and jest were also not used.
